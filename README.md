## What is Budget Bee ?

Budget Bee is a budget/financial tracker application that is built to help the user easily and primitively track and budget his/her day-to-day spending.

## Why Build Budget Bee ?

I was looking for a good budget tracking app and didn't find one that I liked so I decided to build one from react and utilize custom hooks and contexts while building this application to further practice these React.js fundamentals.

## The Technologies Behind Ceasar Tracker

This project uses React.js as a framework and as usual tailwind css for styling. Might possibly make it a multi-paged web/smartphone application in the future that's why you can see the addition of react-router-dom in App.js
